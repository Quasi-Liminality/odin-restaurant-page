            <h1>About Odin's</h1>
            <p>
                Step into a slice of culinary eternity! Established circa 3,200 BCE in the glorious city of Uruk, where
                civilization
                itself was born, Odin's has been serving humanity (and the occasional deity) for over
                five millennia.
                That’s right—this is not just a restaurant. This is history on a plate.
            </p>
            <h1>Our Origins</h1>
            <p>
                Founded by the legendary Enheduanna the Elder (self-declared "First Restaurateur of Humanity"), Odin's
                began as a humble tavern catering to scribes fresh out of cuneiform practice. Legend has it that
                Enheduanna
                invented hummus here, inspired by a divine dream sent by Inanna herself. Over the centuries, we’ve
                expanded our menu and
                polished our craft—one Mesopotamian mezze platter at a time.
            </p>
            <h1>Our Commitment</h1>
            <p>
                From the first amphora of beer lovingly served to Gilgamesh himself, to the exquisite lamb kebabs you’ll
                enjoy today, our mission has always been the same: legendary service, epic meals, and zero complaints
                (except that one
                time during the Babylonian captivity… but we don’t talk about that).
            </p>
            <h1>Join the Legacy</h1>
            <p>
                Odin's isn’t just a restaurant—it’s an odyssey through time, taste, and tantalizing
                traditions. So why wait another thousand years? Book your table today and become part of the most
                legendary dining
